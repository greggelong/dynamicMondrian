# dynamicMondrian
Make a moving Mondrian painting using an array of block objects.

This is inspired by reading the book Code as Creative Medium, 

which is a handbook for teachers and students to explore the 

creative coding. They have creating a Modrian as a graphic exercise.

Here students would lay out colors, rectangles and lines. 

An inspiring and satisfying activity for students just getting into coding.

Here I am expanding on the idea making a block class and an array of

blocks that I can move around.  It keeps some of the flavor of the Modrian

that inspired the process. #createivecode #p5js #mondrian
